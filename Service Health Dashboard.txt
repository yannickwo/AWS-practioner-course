Okay. Hello, Cloud Gurus and welcome to this lecture.
This is a very quick lecture on the Service Health Dashboard. Now,
basically the Service Health Dashboard is exactly what it sounds like.
It is a way of seeing the health of the different AWS services.
So it gives you an overview of all regions and it shows you basically every
single region and the health of all of those AWS services in those regions,
you can also pull daily historical information,
so you can review all historical information for each AWS service on a per day
basis and it also gives you RSS feeds.
So you can subscribe to RSS feeds and get immediate notifications.
If a specific service in a particular region goes down.
So in order to see the Service Health Dashboard,
you could just type it into Google, or you can go to status.aws.amazon.com,
and then it will basically bring up a feed like this.
You can see here for North America there because everything's operating normally
when I'm recording this and it goes a very, very long way down.
So you can see all the different historical information for North America,
South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Pacific, and the Middle East.
So going into your exam, all you really need to know is if you've got an outage,
how can you view it?
based on the service where you can use this Service Health Dashboard.
What they also like to try and do is confuse you with the Personal Health
Dashboard and we'll cover that off in the next lecture.
So if you've got the time, please join me in the next lecture. Thank you.
