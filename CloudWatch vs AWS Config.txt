Okay, hello Cloud Gurus,
and welcome to this lecture.
In this lecture, we're going to look at the difference
between CloudWatch and AWS Config.
In the exam, they're going to throw Inspector at you,
they're going to throw Trusted Advisor at you,
they're going to throw CloudWatch at you,
they're going to throw AWS Config at you,
and the services can be a bit confusing.
And you're just going to need to know the differences
between those four different services and their use case.
And what will happen is you'll be given
a scenario-based question, and it will be like,
it'll be basically saying,
hey, should you use Inspector for this,
or should you be using AWS Config,
or should you be using CloudWatch?
Et cetera, et cetera.
So, so long as you have a good grasp
of those four different services,
you will do absolutely fine in the exam.
So let's start with CloudWatch, what is CloudWatch?
Well CloudWatch is all about monitoring performance,
that's all it is.
It's an online monitoring service
to monitor your AWS resources,
as well as the applications that you run on AWS.
So like I said, it's all about performance,
so I want you to think of CloudWatch as someone
in a gym, for example, and they're working out.
So basically, that's what CloudWatch does,
it monitors performance of your AWS Resources.
So we use CloudWatch a lot with EC2,
EC2 are virtual machines in the clouds,
and they actually sit on the host,
so physical servers, as virtual machines.
And then the host basically reports back to CloudWatch,
and you can get things like your CPU utilization,
your network utilization, your disk utilization,
and the status check of your EC2 instance.
So those are called host level metrics.
Then you can have also have custom metrics with CloudWatch,
you need to basically go and write a script
that will send information back to CloudWatch,
but you can send basically anything to CloudWatch.
So you can do things like your RAM utilization,
you can see how much storage you've still got left
on your EBS volumes, you could see the number of people
that's logged into your WordPress site, things like that.
You just need to be able to write the script
and report it back to CloudWatch.
So CloudWatch, all it does is monitor performance.
AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration
of your AWS resources in your AWS account.
This includes how the resources are related
to one another, and how they were configured in the past.
So you can see the configurations
and relationships change over time.
So this could be things,
this is basically the configuration of your AWS account.
So, when we set up our WordPress site,
if you remember we went to the settings and we changed the,
you know, the IP address from being our EC2 IP address
to being the RDS endpoint.
That's where in WordPress,
that's where we go and edit all the settings to WordPress.
Well AWS Config, what that does is it monitors
the configuration of the settings of your AWS environment.
So it could be that you, your web DMZ had, you know,
port 22, so the SSH port locked down
to a particular IP address up until last Friday,
and then somebody went in and deleted that,
or they made a change and opened it up to the world.
The cool thing about Config is it will show you,
you know, that configuration,
so it will show you that configuration change.
So Config is all about configuration,
whereas CloudWatch is all about performance.
So if you see an exam question where it's asking you
about security group changing,
that's a configuration change,
so you want AWS Config.
If you see a question about RDS performance,
such as the number of connections on a database,
that's going to be AWS CloudWatch.
So that is the two services that you need, you know,
will often be compared to each other.
Like I said in the previous lecture,
we also have AWS Inspector as well as AWS Trusted Advisor.
So just remember that CloudWatch is used
for monitoring performance,
and AWS Config is used to monitor the configuration
of your AWS Resources.
So in the last lecture, we looked at AWS Inspector,
we looked at Trusted Advisor,
and then we looked at CloudTrail.
In this lecture, we looked at CloudWatch,
and then we also looked AWS Config.
So those are the five different services,
and you're going to get a scenario-based question
in the exam, and that's going to ask you
which is the best service to use.
So long as you have a clear understanding
between the differences, between
AWS Inspector, Trusted Advisor, CloudTrail,
CloudWatch, and then AWS Config,
you will absolutely ace the exam.
It's probably worth about, anywhere between four
to seven or eight points.
So just have a clear understanding
of those five different services.
So that is it for this lecture everyone,
if you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.
