Okay. Hello, Cloud Gurus and welcome to this lecture. Another very quick one.
We're now going to look at Personal Health Dashboard.
So you saw the Service Health Dashboard.
It basically showed every AWS service in every region.
Now you're probably not going to be using every AWS service in every region.
What would be more pertinent to you is which services do I actually use and
what is their status? And that's where the Personal Health Dashboard comes in.
So basically it's a dashboard that's personalized for you.
It offers an overview of the AWS services that you actually use and whether or
not they're having any availability issues and it gives you relevant up-to-date
information of the status of your AWS services and it also provides
proactive notifications as to any scheduled activities.
So to get to the Personal Health Dashboard,
we just click on Services and you can scroll down to Management and Governance,
and you'll see it in here, Personal Health Dashboard, click on that.
And that will then show you the your Personal Health Dashboard and go in
and create rules to set up alerts in case something goes down,
this is a brand new AWS account,
so I'm not actually using any services right now.
Yours might look a little bit different to this. So going into the exam,
just remember the difference between the service health dashboard and the
Personal Health Dashboard.
The service health dashboard will show you all AWS services.
Whereas the Personal Health Dashboard will show you just the services that you
use. So that's it for me. If you have any questions, please let me know. If not,
feel free to move on to the next lecture. Thank you.
