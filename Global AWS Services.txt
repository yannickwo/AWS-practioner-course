Okay. Hello, Cloud Gurus and welcome to this very, very quick lecture.
In this lecture, we're going to look at global AWS services.
So this can come up in the exam and you need to identify which services are
global and which are regional.
So identity access management is the very first service that we touched,
and that is global.
When you create a user or a group or a role or a policy that
applies globally, there's no user for a specific region.
It is a global service.
Then we have Route 53 is when you go and register a domain name.
This again is a global service. It's not tied to any particular region.
CloudFront, when you set up a CloudFront CDN,
this is also a global service.
SNS and SES are also global services.
So remember those five going into your exam,
some services give global views, but are regional.
So S3 is a perfect example of that.
You can see all your S3 buckets in one single pane of glass,
but those S3 buckets are located in individual regions.
So in US East 1 or in the London region, or the Paris region, et cetera,
et cetera. So bear that in mind. Like I said, this is a super quick lecture.
So just remember the important global services going into your exam:
Identity and Access Management, Route 53, CloudFront, SNS, and SES.
If you have any questions, please let me know. If not,
feel free to move on to the next lecture. Thank you.
