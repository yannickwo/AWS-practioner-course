Okay. Hello, Cloud Gurus and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture,
we're just going to quickly have a look at identity access management,
best practices.
So really what you need to know going into your exam is the following best
practices and it's really valuable for you in real life to know this as well.
So we'll start with the root account.
Only use the root account to create your AWS account.
Do not use it to log in with. Instead,
create your own user and give them administrator access and then you'll be able
to do everything that the root account user can do as well. With your users.
You should only have one user should equal one real human being.
Don't create Phantom users with user groups and policies always place your
users in groups,
and then apply policies to the groups that makes management much easier.
If you can avoid it,
don't apply policies to individual users because it can be become
basically a management nightmare password policies.
Make sure you have a strong password rotation policies.
Multifactor authentication always enable MFA wherever possible roles.
We're going to cover that off a bit later, but you use roles to access various,
um, uh, other AWS services. So for example,
we might give a role to a virtual machine so it's allowed to talk to S3,
or it's allowed to report stuff back to CloudWatch,
which is a monitoring service and we will cover that off later on as well with
access keys,
use access keys for programmatic access to AWS and we're going to cover that off
later on in the course, and then IAM credential reports.
You use your IAM credential report to audit the permissions of your
users and accounts. So that is it.
Just remember these best practices going into your exam as well as in real life.
If you have any questions, please let me know. If not,
feel free to move on to the next lecture. Thank you.
