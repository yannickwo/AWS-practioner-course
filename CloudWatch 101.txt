Okay. Hello, Cloud Guru and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture,
we're going to look at CloudWatch and we're going to look at CloudWatch at a
very high level. Essentially,
what you need to understand for the certified cloud practitioner exam is just
what CloudWatch is. So what is CloudWatch? Well,
CloudWatch is a monitoring service to monitor your AWS resources as well as the
applications that you run on AWS.
So CloudWatch is all about monitoring performance.
Whenever you think of CloudWatch,
I want you to think of a personal trainer with you at the gym,
and they're monitoring your performance.
They're making sure that you are lifting the right amount of weights, et cetera.
So what does it actually mean in the AWS world? Well,
CloudWatch monitor things like compute. They can monitor your EC2 instances,
a commodity, your auto scaling groups, your Elastic Load Balancers.
It can do things like your Route 53 health checks, et cetera, et cetera.
it can monitor storage and content delivery. So it can look at your EBS volumes,
which are just your virtual hard disks that are attached to EC2.
It can look at things like storage gateway could look at things like CloudFront
and then it also monitors the underlying physical host.
So whenever you have an EC2 instance or a virtual machine,
it's always sitting on a physical server somewhere and CloudWatch can actually
monitor those physical servers as well. So it can monitor things like the CPU.
It can monitor things like the network, the disk, the status checks.
So whether or not the host is healthy or not, and that's it,
that's all you really need to understand about CloudWatch going into the exam.
Now, towards the end of this course,
we are going to cover things like CloudWatch to CloudTrail to AWS
Inspector, et cetera, et cetera but right now,
all you need to understand is what CloudWatch is. So going into your,
just remember what CloudWatch is used, it's used for monitoring performance.
CloudWatch can monitor most of AWS as well as your applications, right?
Run on AWS.
you can actually create custom metrics so you can install it custom bits of
software on your web servers.
And you could monitor the number of users visiting your website,
or you could monitor things like the number of open database connections to
RDS, et cetera, et cetera.
CloudWatch with EC2 will monitor events every five minutes by default.
You can have one minute intervals by turning on detailed monitoring,
and you can create CloudWatch alarms,
which will then go and trigger notifications and CloudWatch. overall,
just remember it's all about performance.
So when you see CloudWatch in the exam, think of the you know,
the example of a personal trainer, who's monitoring your performance
and like I said, at the end of this course,
we're going to compare a whole bunch of AWS services that sounds similar,
but they all do different things.
And when you go into the certified cloud practitioner exam, honestly,
it's probably going to be worth about 10 marks,
knowing the difference between CloudTrail, CloudWatch, AWS Inspector,
AWS Trusted Advisor, et cetera, et cetera and we will cover all that off at the,
the end of the course, but for now, just for me,
but that CloudWatch is all about monitoring performance.
So that is it for this lecture everyone. If you have any questions,
please let me know if not, feel free to move on to the next lecture. Thank you.
